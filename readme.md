## Slide 2: Principle #1: Fluid Grid Layouts
Description: Fluid Grid Layouts help to design the structure of the page in relative units like percentages, instead of absolute units like pixels. This ensures that the elements adjust according to the screen size.
Example: Creating a simple layout with HTML and CSS, with percentages instead of fixed widths.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.container {
    width: 100%;
}
.box {
    width: 50%;
    float: left;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
    <div class="box">Box 1</div>
    <div class="box">Box 2</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Slide 3: Principle #2: Flexible Images
Description: Images should also be flexible to avoid them getting larger than their containing elements. This prevents breaking layouts on smaller screens and ensures images look good on all devices.

Example: Making an image flexible using HTML and CSS.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.flexible {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img class="flexible" src="image.jpg">
</body>
</html>

```

# Slide 4: Principle #3: Media Queries
Description: Media Queries allow applying different styles for different devices. They can check many things, such as width and height of the viewport, width and height of the device, orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?), and resolution.

Example: Creating a simple media query in CSS.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

```

# Slide 5: Principle #4: Mobile First Approach
Description: In the Mobile First Approach, we start by designing for the smallest screen sizes and gradually enhance the design for larger screens. This is an effective strategy to ensure your design looks good on a wide range of devices.

Example: Demonstrating how to design for mobile first using media queries.

---
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: white;
    }
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

```

# Slide 6: Principle #5: CSS Flexbox
Description: Flexbox is a layout module in CSS that allows easy alignment of elements on the main axis or the cross axis of the current line of the flex container. This makes it a powerful tool for creating responsive designs.

Example: Creating a simple Flexbox layout with CSS and HTML.

---
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.flex-container {
    display: flex;
}
.flex-item {
    flex: 1;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

```
# Slide 7: Principle #6: CSS Grid
Description: CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you layout content within rows and columns, and has features that make building complex responsive designs easier.

Example: Demonstrating a simple grid layout with CSS and HTML.

---
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}
.grid-item {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 20px;
    font-size: 30px;
    text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 3</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 4</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

```
# Slide 8: Principle #7: Using REM and EM Units
Description: REM and EM are scalable units in CSS. EM is relative to the parent font-size, and REM is relative to the root (or html) font-size. These units allow for flexible and scalable designs.

Example: Using REM and EM units in CSS.

---
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    font-size: 16px;
}
.rem-text {
    font-size: 2rem;
}
.em-text {
    font-size: 2em;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p class="rem-text">This text is 2rem.</p>
<p class="em-text">This text is 2em.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

# Slide 9: Principle #8: Utilizing Viewport Units
Description: Viewport units in CSS are length units representing a percentage of the current viewport dimensions: the vw unit represents a percentage of the viewport width, and vh is a percentage of the viewport height.

Example: Showing how to use viewport units in CSS.

---
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.vw-text {
    font-size: 5vw;
}
.vh-text {
    font-size: 5vh;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p class="vw-text">This text scales with viewport width.</p>
<p class="vh-text">This text scales with viewport height.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

# Slide 10: Principle #9: Responsive Typography
Description: Responsive Typography involves using flexible units so the text can adjust its size based on the screen size. This ensures that the text remains readable across different devices.

Example: Creating responsive typography using CSS.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    font-size: 2vw;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    body {
        font-size: 1.5em;
    }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
    body {
        font-size: 2em;
    }
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an example of responsive typography.</p>
</body>
</html>
